    "# Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to Riceroll's Koboldcpp and Ollama benchmarking notebook! The sole purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate inference speeds and KV Caching implementation of Ollama and KoboldCPP.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read about Ollama's KV Cache here: https://smcleod.net/2024/12/bringing-k/v-context-quantisation-to-ollama/  \n",
    "You can learn more about Kobold's Context-Shift here: https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/wiki#what-is-contextshift  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re not familiar with what inference means in LLMs, it simply means the total time it took to:\n",
    "- Process the prompt (system prompts, user prompts, etc.)\n",
    "- Generate tokens (the LLM outputs) \\**This is a little tricky since we also have to consider the number of tokens generated per second.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also be testing out the KV caching features that both KoboldCPP and Ollama implement. They’re KV caching solutions provide good benefits to the overall inference speeds but serve different purposes. I will briefly explain more about them below.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For our model, we will be using Mistral Nemo Instruct Q6_K_L gguf model for our benchmarks. We will also be testing these models using the F16 quantization KV cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the hardware to run these benchmarks and models, it is run on my personal computer with an RTX 5080, Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and 64GB of DDR5 RAM. The GPU has just enough VRAM to fully run a Mistral Nemo Q6_K_L model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that being said, let’s dive into the benchmarking! "

    "### The Setup\n",
    "We will be using Text Completions endpoints. The reason being is that we can better utilize the KV cache feature of both Ollama and KoboldCPP. We also have a lot of big prompts that will be sent to the same Mistal Nemo Instruct models under Ollama and KoboldCPP. These big prompts are here to simulate long conversations stretching thousands of tokens in the model's context window. Once the context window hits it's max, the KV caching magic happens for both KoboldCPP and Ollama."

    "# KoboldCPP Context-Shift vs Ollama KV Caching\n",
    "Without going into too much detail (You can find more details on the articles I listed at the very top), here's a simple explanation as to what's really going on behind the scenes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, Let's talk about **KoboldCPP's Context-Shift**. With context-shift, the model keeps track of previous conversation tokens in memory and shifts them via KV Cache Shifting as new tokens arrive. When the max_context_length is reached, the Kobold drops any old tokens from the earliest part of the conversation. What's special about this is that when they drop the old conversations, they can add any new tokens/conversation into the current context and completely avoid reprocessing of the full prompt + system prompt. This explains why KoboldCPP can maintain a steady TPS as shown in the benchmarks above. The only downside is that context-shift does affect the TPS but very minimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about **Ollama's KV Caching**? Simply put, it just stores Key/Value embeddings of past tokens in the context. What's neat about this is that there is absolutely no reprocessing **only on parts of the prompt that hasn't changed** *and* **as long as the max context window is not reached**. Once the max context window overflows, Ollama will need to throw out old parts of the conversation, add the new parts in, and then they **must reprocess everything**. And at this point, every inference potentially makes it slower and slower each time because it has to do the \"oh no! too much stuff! time to throw old stuff out, bring new stuff in, and reprocess everything\" over and over. The pros to this approach is that your TPS initially is blazing fast (theoretically, Ollama's TPS would be faster than KoboldCPP's initially). The biggest cons however is that once you reach that max context windows, it's going to chug.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, both Ollama and Kobold are amazing solutions to run LLM models. However, if you need something to hold longer conversations and be consistently fast, Kobold is my choice. If you want ease of use and don't mind keeping track of the number of tokens in your model to prevent max ctx window overflow, then Ollama is a fantastic choice as well."
